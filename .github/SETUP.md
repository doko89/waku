# GitHub Actions Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use GitHub Actions for WAKU project to create automated releases.

## Prerequisites

- Repository admin or write access
- GitHub account

## Setup Required: SSH Deploy Key

The workflow uses SSH Deploy Key to push tags, which allows it to trigger the build workflow automatically.

### Why SSH Deploy Key?

By default, when a workflow uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push tags, GitHub **does not trigger** other workflows (to prevent recursive workflows). To solve this, we use an SSH Deploy Key which is treated as an external push, thus triggering the build workflow.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Generate SSH Key Pair

On your local machine:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key (no passphrase)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions-waku" -f ~/.ssh/waku_deploy_key -N ""

# This creates two files:
# - waku_deploy_key (private key)
# - waku_deploy_key.pub (public key)
```

### 2. Add Deploy Key to Repository

1. **Copy the public key**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/waku_deploy_key.pub
   ```

2. **Add to GitHub**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/settings/keys
   - Click "Add deploy key"
   - Title: `GitHub Actions Deploy Key`
   - Key: Paste the public key content
   - ‚úÖ Check "Allow write access"
   - Click "Add key"

### 3. Add Private Key to Secrets

1. **Copy the private key**:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/waku_deploy_key
   ```

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/settings/secrets/actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY`
   - Secret: Paste the **entire private key** (including `-----BEGIN` and `-----END` lines)
   - Click "Add secret"

### 4. Verify Setup

After adding both keys:

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/actions/workflows/create-tag.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter a test version (e.g., `1.0.3`)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Watch both workflows run:
   - ‚úÖ Create Tag workflow
   - ‚úÖ Build and Release workflow (auto-triggered)

## How to Use

### Creating a Release

1. **Go to Actions**:
   - https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/actions/workflows/create-tag.yml

2. **Click "Run workflow"**

3. **Enter version** (without 'v' prefix):
   - Example: `1.0.3`

4. **Click "Run workflow"**

5. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - ‚úÖ Tag `v1.0.3` is created
   - ‚úÖ Tag is pushed via SSH
   - ‚úÖ Build workflow automatically starts
   - ‚úÖ Binaries are built for 7 platforms
   - ‚úÖ GitHub Release is created with all artifacts

### Available Workflows

You should see two workflows in Actions tab:

1. **Create Tag and Build** - Main workflow to create releases
2. **Build and Release** - Automatically triggered by tags

## Workflow Behavior

### With SSH_DEPLOY_KEY (Current Setup)

```
User triggers "Create Tag and Build" workflow
    ‚Üì
Checkout code with SSH agent
    ‚Üì
Validate version format
    ‚Üì
Pull latest changes
    ‚Üì
Create tag v1.0.3
    ‚Üì
Push tag via SSH (git@github.com:...)
    ‚Üì
Build workflow is AUTOMATICALLY triggered ‚úÖ
    ‚Üì
Build binaries for 7 platforms
    ‚Üì
Generate checksums
    ‚Üì
Create GitHub Release with all artifacts
    ‚Üì
üéâ Done! Release is live!
```

**Total time:** ~5-10 minutes

### Without SSH_DEPLOY_KEY (Not Recommended)

If SSH_DEPLOY_KEY is not set, the workflow will fail or build won't trigger automatically.

**Why?** Because `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger other workflows (GitHub security feature).

## Troubleshooting

### Build workflow doesn't start automatically

**Possible causes:**
1. `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` secret is not set
2. Deploy key is not added to repository
3. Deploy key doesn't have write access

**Solution:**
1. Verify `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` secret exists:
   - Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/settings/secrets/actions
   - Check if `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` is listed

2. Verify deploy key is added:
   - Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/settings/keys
   - Check if deploy key exists with write access

3. If missing, follow setup steps above

### Tag already exists error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Delete tag locally (if exists)
git tag -d v1.0.3

# Delete tag on GitHub
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.3

# Delete release (if exists)
# Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waku/releases
# Click on the release ‚Üí Delete

# Try again with the same or different version
```

### SSH authentication failed

**Error message:** `Permission denied (publickey)`

**Solution:**
1. Regenerate SSH key pair
2. Make sure you copied the **entire** private key (including BEGIN/END lines)
3. Make sure public key is added as deploy key with write access
4. Try again

### Build fails

**Check:**
1. Go to "Actions" tab
2. Click on the failed workflow run
3. Check the logs for specific errors
4. Common issues:
   - Go version mismatch (should be 1.24)
   - Missing dependencies (run `go mod download`)
   - Platform-specific build errors

## Security Notes

### SSH Deploy Key Security

- ‚úÖ **DO**: Store private key in repository secrets (encrypted)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Use key only for this repository
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Enable write access only if needed
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Delete old keys when rotating
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Share private key with anyone
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Commit private key to code
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Use same key for multiple repositories
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Add passphrase (GitHub Actions can't handle it)

### Key Rotation

Rotate SSH keys periodically (e.g., every 6-12 months):

1. Generate new SSH key pair
2. Add new public key as deploy key
3. Update `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` secret with new private key
4. Test workflow
5. Delete old deploy key

## Alternative: Using Personal Access Token (PAT)

If you prefer PAT over SSH:

1. Create PAT with `repo` and `workflow` scopes
2. Add as `PAT_TOKEN` secret
3. Modify workflow to use PAT instead of SSH

**Note:** SSH Deploy Key is more secure and recommended for CI/CD.

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check workflow logs in Actions tab
2. Verify SSH_DEPLOY_KEY secret is set correctly
3. Verify deploy key has write access
4. Check SSH key format (must include BEGIN/END lines)
5. Open an issue on GitHub

## Summary

‚úÖ **Current Setup (SSH Deploy Key):**
- Generate SSH key pair
- Add public key as deploy key (with write access)
- Add private key as `SSH_DEPLOY_KEY` secret
- Workflows work automatically
- More secure than PAT

‚úÖ **Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Automatic build triggering
- ‚úÖ No token expiration issues
- ‚úÖ Repository-specific access
- ‚úÖ Better security audit trail
- ‚úÖ No manual intervention needed

üéØ **Result:**
One-click release creation with full automation!
